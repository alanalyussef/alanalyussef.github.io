Hello! I am a postdoctoral researcher in economics at the department of Applied Economics ([**APEC**](https://researchportal.vub.be/en/persons/alan-al-yussef)) at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel ([**VUB**](https://www.vub.be/en)). I research how economic circumstances shape collective behavior and how institutions moderate this dynamic. 
The current focus of my research is on political preferences and voting behavior. For my research, besides tapping into the rich body of theory and methodologies economics offers, I often wander beyond the disciplinary boundaries in search of different perspectives and new insights. My oft-visited territories are sociology, political science and social psychology. 

In addition to my research activities, I have served as a teaching assistant for Microeconomics and Public Choice courses. Additionally, I have supervised several bachelor's theses and oversaw research projects for the course "Research Methods in Economics and Management." In these roles, I liked to assign tasks to students that prompted them to explore the social, political, and cultural aspects of the economy. Their enthusiasm for these questions was truly inspiring.

I currently teach Research Methods for Business (as courseholder) and serve as master thesis supervisor at the VUB.
