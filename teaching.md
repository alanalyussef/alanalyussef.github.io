#Teaching:

During my PhD, I served as a teaching assistant for several courses, including Introduction to Microeconomics (undergraduate level), Microeconomics for Management (a preparatory course for graduate programmes in management), and Public Choice (graduate level). I have also supervised numerous student research projects in the context of courses such as Research Methods in Economics and Management, as well as serving as a bachelor’s thesis supervisor.

I currently serve as a visiting professor in the Department of Applied Economics (APEC) and as a postdoctoral researcher in the Department of Business Technology and Operations (BUTO) at VUB. In these roles, I teach Research Methods for Business (course holder) and supervise several master’s thesis research projects.
